deckpage to show all the item

create react app with name client
create signup component
now we need to send data to back end that why we require axios 
instal npm i axios

when we send data from front end to back end here we have to face cors erro
CORS=CROSS ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING ERROR
npm i cors in server and require in server.js file and add as a middleware
